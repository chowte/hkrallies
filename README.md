This repository contains NetLogo models for various rallies in Hong Kong.

The Netlogo model is an agent-based model to simulate complex crowd behaviours in a rally. It can also be used to estimate the crowd size in a rally by careful adoptation, calibration, and verification. Collaborators are welcome to improve the model and advance our understanding about crowd behaviours and human dynamics in various geographic phenomena.
